# US Gun Violence Data Analysis (2013-2018) 
Data analysis of US Gun Violence Record from 2013-2018 was completed as a final project of CareerFoundry data analytics course. 

## Objective
Aim of this project is to provide meaningful interpretation of the data and derive insightful hypothesis that could be tested to understand the variables within the data. 

## Key Questions
Is there a specific region with higher number of gun violence incidents? Is there an increase in number of incidents throughout the year?
Is there any correlation between time of the year and number of incidents? Is there any trend in number of incidents and region throughout the year? Which state has the highest number of cases? 

## Analysis Performed
Python was used to perform statistical analysis, geographical analysis, regression analysis, spatial analysis, cluster analysis and time-series analysis.

## Limitations
Data is from January 2013 to March 2018 so most recent data is missing.
Data from 2013 is incomplete because not all incidents were recorded
